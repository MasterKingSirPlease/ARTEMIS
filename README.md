# ARTEMIS

<hr>

Designed as a fun game for my younger cousins as a joint project between me and my grandfather, ARTEMIS is a closed-source game progrmamed in Python. This repository serves as a resource for pushing updates, along with storing questions for the game.

Instructions are included with the game files.
